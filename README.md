# RetroPilot Fork Generator

## What's this?

This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dash-software-ltd/openpilot) periodically generates openpilot branches from comma's openpilot with modifications to talk to the RetroPilot API.

## FAQ

### How often are the branches generated?

Every day. If the base commits haven't changed, the generated commits have a stable hash and will not change.

### Custom Forks?

Please talk to the fork maintainer about adding an option to use the RetroPilot API server. Feel free to add a toggle to your own fork, however it is recommended to give users a choice between the comma and RetroPilot API servers.

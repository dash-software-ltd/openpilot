# bluepilot fork generator

## What's this?

This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dash-software-ltd/openpilot) periodically generates openpilot branches from comma's openpilot with modifications to talk to the bluepilot API.

## FAQ

### How do I install it?

Factory reset your device and enter one of the custom software installer URLs.

### How often are the branches generated?

Every day. If the base commits haven't changed, the generated commits have a stable hash and will not change.

### Custom Forks?

Please talk to the fork maintainer about adding an option to use the bluepilot API. Feel free to add a toggle to your own fork, however it is recommended to give users a choice between the comma and bluepilot API servers.

#### How do I add this to my fork?

Instructions coming soon.
